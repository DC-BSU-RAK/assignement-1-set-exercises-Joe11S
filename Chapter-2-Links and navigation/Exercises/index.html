                    Inside Out is a 2015 film by Pixar Studios. The story revolves around a young girl named
                    Riley Andersen, whose mind is governed by her five emotions, led by Joy, her very first emotion, 
                    with Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger supporting her journey. She is suddenly uprooted of her childhood 
                    when her father has a new job to San Francisco.<br>
                    <br>
                    She struggled to adjust to her new home, signified by her increased frequency in negative 
                    memories and Sadness unlocks her power to turn happy memories sad (the embodiment of nostalgia), 
                    something that Joy has been suppressing and because of that, things happen - she 
                    starts crying in class (this creates a blue core memory that Joy doesn't want it activated, and
                    ends up with both of them sucked).<br>
                    <br>
                    Now without Joy and Sadness, Riley starts to lose interest in her childhood, as her personality
                    islands start to crumble. Joy and Sadness must make it back to Headquarters before all personality
                    islands crumble, but faces obstacles. In the meantime, they were toured by Bing Bong when they almost
                    got simplified in abstract thought, then they went in his Imagination Land, but is undergoing 
                    renovations, including throwing his rocket in the dump.<br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, Riley then started to resort to going home to Minnesota herself, as orchestrated by Anger,
                    but she must steal her mother's credit card first, which she did - Joy and Sadness were already on
                    their way home as the crumbling Honesty Island hits the Train of Thought, sending it to the dump.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now Joy and Sadness must find another way back, such as a recall tube, but Joy had to enter the
                    tube first, only to end up breaking and Joy and Bing Bong fell to the dump. Riley then starts
                    executing her action to run away.<br>
                    <br>
                    It seems like Joy has completely lost all hope, bursting into tears as she looks at the faded memories
                    of her childhood, when she accidentally rewinded a happy memory - this turns sad, and then ultimately
                    becomes happy. Joy finally understands Sadness' purpose: <b>to signal for help at Riley's lowest.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Their goal is to get out of the dump using the rocket wagon thrown earlier, but the rocket is too heavy, so
                    Bing Bong decided to sacrifice himself by jumping off the rocket wagon to reduce its weight and save Joy.
                    Bing Bong then faded.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now Joy needs to find Sadness and bring her back to headquarters as Riley continues to run away. Her mother
                    repeatedly tried to call her only to have it declined. Meanwhile, other emotions realized that running
                    away is a bad idea, and tried to take it out of the slot, only to start turning the console black.
                    Joy must act fast, and used the idea of using imaginary boyfriends to use the trampoline on what remains of
                    Family Island to catch Sadness, and hit the window of the Headquarters. Disgust provokes Anger into exploding
                    into flames, which she uses to break the window and allow Joy and Sadness inside. <br>
                    <br>
                    Joy lets Sadness to the console, which she successfully removes the idea of running away (which makes Riley go home). 
                    She turns all the happy core memories sad, and projects them with the viewer. Riley breaks to tears 
                    in front of her parents and in turn her parents empathize with Riley. They have a moment, and Riley creates
                    a new dual-color core memory that forms a much larger Family Island.<br>
                    <br>
                    A year later, Riley's happiness is back, and is ready to play hockey when she bumped into a guy on accident.
                    She gives the bottle back to him and continued her hockey game.

                <q>Inside Out movingly but casually plays with our emotions, like a baby walking her fingers across a parent's face; 
                it leaves you changed, entertained, nostalgic, dazzled.<br> - Moira Macdonald, Metacritic</q><br>
                <br>
                <q>Inside Out is nearly hallucinogenic, entirely beautiful and easily the animation studio's 
                best release since 2010's "Toy Story 3." Stylistically Inside Out is nothing like Richard Linklater's 
                "Boyhood," but for its scope in examining the maturation process, it might well be called "Childhood."<br> - Mary Pols, Metacritic</q><br>
                <br>
                <q>Pixar's brilliantly conceived and realized Inside Out illuminates a tween girl's conflicted
                     emotional life with superb storytelling, animation and performances.<br> - Jennifer Merin, Rotten Tomatoes</q>
